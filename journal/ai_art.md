# AI Art and the New, Strange Normal

Today I am going to try to generate an image that is perfect for the prototypical "student scheduler" application. I am on a team in a class focused on user experience (or, UX) and we are developing a prototype for a class-scheduling application. I have been seeing art generated by Artificial Intelligence (AI) all over the place, and I would like to explore the topic first hand and make note of my experience here.

By "generate an image that is perfect" for our application, what I mean is an image that appropriately sets expectations for what our software does. We schedule classes, and try to incorporate the students' extra-curricular activities so they can schedule around those. 

Since the earliest computers, humans have been interested in using formulas to create art through digital means. This involves providing the computer with boundaries, rules, and carefully crafted language, rather than directly telling it where to place each pixel. AI art takes this concept to its extreme, using advanced algorithms and machine learning to create complex and intriguing artworks. While some may debate whether or not this truly qualifies as "intelligence," there is no denying the incredible potential of AI to revolutionize the world of art.

As AI technology continues to advance, we are seeing more and more examples of AI-generated art in the news. From abstract portraits to surreal landscapes, AI-generated art is captivating audiences and sparking debate about the nature of creativity and originality. In some cases, news articles themselves are using AI to generate images or graphics, showcasing the potential of this technology to enhance storytelling and visual communication.

This increasing prevalence of AI art in the news begs the question: how can we, as users, experience and interact with this technology? In the next section of this blog post, I will describe my own experience of trying to generate an AI image for the first time, and discuss the challenges and insights I gained from this process. Stay tuned to find out more about my journey into the world of AI art. 

Two of the AI art generators that work based on text prompts that I've heard of are called "DALL-E" and "DALL-E Mini." I will be trying them both out today. I will start with mini, as I believe the full version is a more complicated service. 

First things first, DALL-E Mini is now known as "Craiyon." I assume they had to change the name for legal reasons. They note their former name on their website, this may be for disambiguation but I think this also might be for search algorithm optimization. Regardless, to Craiyon we go in search of great works. 

There is no login required, I am simply greeted with a more or less blank page, with a text prompt front and center. Underneath that is a rectangle clearly labeled "Generated images will appear here!" This is a clean interface. The design is sleek and easy to understand. I'm going to start with some fun prompts just to see what is generated. 

After prompting the site with some text, I'm told the image should be ready in under 2 minutes, and a timer starts to let me know how much time has passed. This is probably useful to researchers, but as a casual user this timer is really comforting. From a design point of view, it has a similar effect as when traffic lights have countdowns associated with them. These have been shown in studies to reduce traffic-related stress. I propose that websites with any significant wait times would reduce stress associated with their software if they gave the user an indication of time relative to their various processes. The advertisements are a little annoying, but hey, it's a free service. I have come to expect that with any free online tool will come advertisements. 

Not even halfway through typing that last paragraph, nine images were presented on the screen. They are... interesting. These are not great works of art, that much is clear. They look like bizarre clip art from another dimension. Maybe it's the prompt I'm using? I will try a few more prompts and comment on their outputs. 


These were very interesting, and the interface is focused and easy to use. I would like to now graduate to this application's big sibling, DALL-E. I first go to the website. 

First impressions, this project has a lot more money behind it. The first thing that is striking is there are zero advertisements across the entire website. Another thing I notice is their user interface (UI) elements. After working on our designs for our scheduling application, I can appreciate good fonts, buttons, and placement. They are proud of their product, don't need to advertise anything but their product, and don't waste precious screen space with details and minutia. 

While their website is very cool, I do not see the obvious steps to generate images like I did on the last website from Craiyon. I assume I need to sign up? That kinda makes sense. Am I going to have to pay for this? I worry a little bit as I click the sign up button. This feels higher-stakes for some reason than using the previous site. 

I sign in, using a google account so I don't have to make a new account, and there we are. In a similar context to how Craiyon looked. Noting the name change, I assume it is not too wild to say Craiyon probably modeled their website off of DALL-E's. 

I'm told I have 50 "credits." Uh oh. I do not like the sound of that. It sounds like a web-site specific version of money. A very common scheme right now is to give a user some "credits," or whatever your application chooses to call them, and then when the user has spent some time in the application and runs out of credits, they are prompted to purchase more to continue. This always feels bad to me, though I completely understand it from a business perspective. 

I looked more into how these credits work and you are given 50 initially, then 15 each month following with no rollover. This is not a bad system. But with how hard it was to find good images on the last service, I am hesitant to use my credits as I do not want to waste them on bad prompts! Well here goes nothing, for technology and for the future of art and mankind, I will use these free credits. One credit equals one query, from what I read. 

The first prompt I give to it is "student scheduler." I get four images, none of which really exemplify what I am interested in. Total failure. I'm going to get more specific. 

This time I try "student scheduler software application logo which represents a focus on extra-curricular activities. drawn style, clock involved, and make it look like corporate art." To my surprise, I actually get some rather good images! The text is what I can only describe as AI filler text, but the composition and content of these images is actually rather high quality. 

This time around I'm trying "corporate logo that is fun, cool, hip, shows diversity and poetic composition while also showcasing the main elements of our application, which are scheduling classes, scheduling extra-curricular activities, and being fast and efficient." I don't know if I used too many words, the wrong words, or what, but I do not really like images nearly as much as the previous round. 

For the prompt "corporate graphic which looks hand-drawn, for a class-scheduling application that emphasizes students' extra-curricular activities," I got undesirable but interesting results. This one lead the AI to make images that really focused on the rigidness of scheduling. 

I could do this all day, so I think I will! I won't bore you with every result however. AI art seems to be extremely easy to generate, albeit the more clear and useful art is a paid service. I found the art of querying to be a challenging puzzle all in itself. I had to take time to think of prompts that would yield results I wanted, and when they worked I felt like I had done something, like I had somehow contributed to what I saw before me. When I got undesired results in the totally free version, Craiyon, it was a little inconveniencing but fine. In DALL-E, where each generation costs a "credit," I felt somewhat stressed out by the experience. 

Generating desired results from AI image generation is not as easy as I once imagined it to be. As I continue to experiment with Craiyon and DALL-E, I am starting to see that the quality of the images generated is highly dependent on the prompt I provide. When I use more specific and detailed prompts, the images generated are more coherent and seem to better match what I was expecting. However, when I use more general or vague prompts, the images generated are often abstract and difficult to interpret. This suggests that, in order to get the most out of AI art generators, it is important to provide clear and well-defined prompts.

In terms of generating an image for our class-scheduling application, I am having some difficulty coming up with a prompt that will generate an appropriate image. I have tried several different approaches, including describing the features and functionality of the application, as well as the target audience and their needs. However, the images generated do not seem to match my expectations or convey the right message for our application.

One challenge I am facing is that AI art generators, like Craiyon, are still limited in their ability to understand and interpret language. This means that even if I provide a detailed and accurate description of our application, the AI may not be able to fully comprehend it and generate an appropriate image. Additionally, the AI's understanding of art and aesthetics may be different from my own, leading to discrepancies between what I am expecting and what the AI generates.

Overall, my experience with AI art generators has been interesting, but also somewhat frustrating. While it is impressive to see the complex and abstract images that the AI can generate, it can be difficult to use the tool effectively to generate images that match my expectations. This highlights the limitations of current AI art generators and the need for continued development and improvement in this area.
