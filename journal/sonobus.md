# Better Late Than Never
## Remote Work for Musicians
## c/o Avery Pound

I am half of the musical duo **iO**, with my friend Cooper. We started making music together in 2010. 
For much of our career we have lived in the same city, often in the same house. 
This made playing and recording music easy, as we could meet up often in real life.
Currently, there are 140 miles between us, and we meet up to play music more consistently than 
when we lived together. We meet remotely, to play what I carefully describe as *psuedo-live* music. 

### Music and Latency ⏰
*Latency* is the time is takes for some data to get from a source to its destination. 
In an average-to-small room, the latency from when a clap occurs and when your brain perceives the clap
is virtually nonexistent. You hear it so close to the time it happened that if someone repeats clapping
in a steady rhythm, you are able to synchronize with them and clap "on beat" along with them. 
As latency increases, the amount of time between the original clap and your perception of the sound increases. 

Imagine standing a football field away from someone. You start a steady rhythm with clapping.
The other person is attempting to clap along with you, at close to the exact same times as you are clapping.
But you don't hear them synchronizing; their claps do not align with yours. 
You yell to them "Hey! Try to clap in time with me!" They give you the thumbs up. 
You try again, and again you hear the same out-of-synch claps as before. 
Before you yell this person "What the hell is wrong with you?!" 
take a moment to realize you are experiencing *latency*!
Every step of this process takes time, and the more time you add the worse the problem gets.

1) The sound leaves your hands (you hear this almost instantly)
2) The sound hits the other person's ears (they hear it, some time after you heard it)
3) They clap, the sound leaves their hands (they hear it almost instantly, and in synch with your claps to their ears)
4) Their clap hits your ears (you hear theirs so long after yours that you halt the experiment)

Most people can detect latency between of about 15-20 milliseconds. 
Performers, musicians, and audiophiles can detect latency fine as 5-10 milliseconds. 

### Better Late Than Never 💡

When there is so little room for error, one can understand why we did not seriously approach
the task of playing music live remotely (over the internet) for several years. 
Even on a good day for fast internet speeds, we can hope for a 40ms round-trip time for even basic 
requests for text to servers on the internet. Audio is infamous for being slow to read from memory and being 
incredibly CPU-intensive to process. Current average latency, even on great connections, 
far exceeds the acceptable limit of latency.
So why even bother with the idea? 

We compromised with a system of sending files back and forth, using shared cloud storage, 
and constantly updating each other via text messages or emails of what we were working on. 
This process was slow, error-prone, and allowed for long periods of work before feedback was received.
Demotivation was rampant during the years we operated like this, and a lot of work was lost.
We felt we had to admit that our best work was done in person,
and that there simply was no way around this obvious fact. 

While working in my audio program of choice, [Ableton](https://www.ableton.com/en/), I had an inkling of an idea. 
I wanted live audio as a track in my project. 
I had wanted this before, but I was inexplicably confident that I could receive live audio,
with whatever latency, and *make it work.*

### All Aboard the SonoBus 🚌
After trying a handful of competitors, we discovered SonoBus. 
"SonoBus is an easy to use application for streaming high-quality, 
low-latency peer-to-peer audio between devices over the internet 
or a local network." - [SonoBus](https://sonobus.net)

This program was easy to install, and came with a user-friendly wizard. 
Unexpectedly, this is a rare example of free software that runs well on 
Mac's new M-series processor.
